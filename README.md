## 🎥 Should You Post Short Project Videos?

**✅ YES! It's highly advised.**

### Why Videos Work:
- More eye-catching than text or images
- Showcases your personality and communication skills
- Helps employers visualize your work
- Makes you stand out (most devs *don’t* post videos)

### 🛠️ Tips for a Great Project Video:
**Length:** 1–2 minutes max

**Structure:**
1. **Quick Intro (5–10s)** – "Hey, I’m [Your Name], a web dev student. This is a project I built using React & a REST API."
2. **Project Demo (30–60s)** – Click around, show key features and smooth UI/UX.
3. **Code Walkthrough (15–30s)** – Highlight cool logic (e.g., API calls, auth, validation).
4. **Wrap-Up (5–10s)** – "Built this as part of my bootcamp. Open to feedback or collabs!"

### Extra Tips:
- Use Loom or OBS Studio to record
- Add subtitles for accessibility
- Light music (optional)

---

### 📌 What to Include in the LinkedIn Post:
- Upload the video directly
- Short summary of the project
- Tech stack used
- Call to action (feedback, open to work, etc.)
